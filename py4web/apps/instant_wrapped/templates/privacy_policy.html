            <h3>What information do we collect and how do we collect it? </h3>
            <p>We collect all of the relevant music data provided by the Spotify platform using the Spotipy Python
                library. This data includes most listened to songs,
                artists, and genres, as well as profile/playlist pictures.</p>
            <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
            <p>We use the data regarding your most listened to songs to generate playlists that you can save to your
                Spotify library. We also allow you to post these playlists
                to our leaderboard page, where others have their publicly displayed playlists as well. You can also save
                other people's playlists to your library.
                In addition, your aforementioned song data is used as well as
                data about your most listened to artists and genres to display them on your profile page. We also
                use this data to match you with other users who have similar
                tastes. </p>
            <h3>How and where do we process your information?</h3>
            <p>We process your information by breaking down the massive chunk of your Spotify data that is returned by
                the Spotipy library when you generate your most listened to songs or artists
                on your dashboard. We organize the data into the appropriate places using databases, so that we can later display them in the
                necessary places. For instance, the data on your most listened to songs, artists, and genres is processed and stored to be displayed
                in your user profile page. Furthermore, the data on your playlists are saved so that their names are viewable on both your profile page and the leaderboard, and
                each individual song for the previously mentioned playlist is generated and put into a list that can be displayed when you view each individual playlist.
